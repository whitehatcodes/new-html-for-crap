    How are you? Well I hope you are doing good, especially now. But, before we start our journey, let me introduce myself.
    I'm Nathan, an ambitious idiot who likes to mess around with electronics and web development. But, you may ask "well what is this all for?" and, well, that is a fantastic question.
    What I am here for, is to help develop a cleaner, more simplified internet. So, what do you say?
