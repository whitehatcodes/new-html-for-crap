         Hello, ready for an adventure?
     </h1>
     <p>
         Here at (studio name) we put you, the customer, first. we hate when others 
         get put by the wayside, so inorder to stop that, we make the client our first priority. We don't put
         our gain first, our bosses first, or our credit cards first. You and only you are our first concern, so what
         do you say? Ready for an adventure?
     </p>
